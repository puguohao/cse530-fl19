Did not pass testhfMultiPage(), but with some work on it. (-2 points)

The reason why your code does not work is whenever you are checking if the page has a slot, 
you loop from zero to the header size. However, in your calculation, your header size is 106, which 
is much bigger than the number of slots size which is 30, so you get index out of bound exception.
To fix this, you can loop from zero to the number of slots instead of the header size because that
is the total tuple size that can be contained in a page.
